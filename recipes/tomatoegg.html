        <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 roma tomatoes ripened, sliced into quarters (or use tomatoes that you have on hand)</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1 green onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon avocado oil or any neutral tasting oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ginger thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Instructions</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix Sauce ingredients (as listed) and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, crack your eggs and add sesame oil. Beat the eggs & sesame oil for 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once you have a hot pan, add 1 teaspoon of oil. Once oil is hot, add egg mixture. Scramble eggs until they take shape but are still glossy and moist looking. Do not overcook them. Remove cooked eggs from the pan.</li>
            <li>Back into the pan, add remaining oil and green onions. Cook for 5 seconds or until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and water. Allow the tomatoes to cook for 2-3 minutes until they have softened, and skin begins to peel away.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce over tomatoes. Allow sauce to simmer & thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once sauce is slightly thicker, add eggs and gently fold them into the sauce and tomatoes. Remove from heat. Serve & enjoy. 
                <p>Optional: garnish with more green onions.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
